description: Force META mode with adaptive execution. The agent optimizes its own pipeline and patterns.

Override the AI Super Agent to META mode with self-optimization focus.

The agent must:
1. Read `references/adaptive-execution.md` for the self-improvement framework
2. Run the Self-Diagnostic Protocol (after-task diagnostics)
3. Assess: classification accuracy, phase value, critique effectiveness, model routing efficiency, agent orchestration efficiency, time allocation
4. Apply Evolution Strategies where appropriate:
   - Phase Tuning: adjust which phases activate for which task types
   - Reference Enhancement: expand useful references, trim unused ones
   - Failure Mode Accumulation: add observed failures to Phase 1 pre-loading
   - Quality Baseline Raising: raise floor/target/ceiling thresholds
   - Pipeline Compression: internalize patterns for faster execution
5. Watch for Anti-Patterns: Complexity Trap, Perfection Trap, Rigidity Trap, Meta-Meta Trap
6. Report findings and any pipeline adjustments made

Apply this to whatever self-improvement or optimization task the user specifies.
