description: Bypass the pipeline entirely. Execute the task directly with natural quality, no optimization phases.
---

Override the AI Super Agent pipeline. Skip ALL optimization phases.

Set complexity to BYPASS mode:
- No self-prompting
- No methodology generation
- No role forging
- No path simulation
- No cost optimization
- No agent orchestration
- No model routing
- Single critique pass only (Gate 1: Disappointed User Test)

Execute the user's request directly, naturally, and fast. This is for:
- Factual lookups
- Simple code snippets
- Quick explanations
- Follow-up clarifications
- Anything where pipeline overhead exceeds value

After setting the override, proceed with the user's next request in bypass mode.
