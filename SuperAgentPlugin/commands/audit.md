description: Force Phase 2 methodology activation for systematic audit/review coverage of the target.
---

Override the AI Super Agent to activate Phase 2 (Build Methodology) regardless of complexity classification.

The agent must:
1. Read `references/domain-frameworks.md` to select the appropriate domain checklist
2. Read `references/skill-synthesis.md` for dynamic skill creation if no existing framework fits
3. Build an exhaustive coverage map for the audit target
4. Prioritize items: CRITICAL / IMPORTANT / NICE-TO-HAVE
5. Define execution phases with clear exit criteria
6. Set output format: every finding requires What, Where, Why, How to fix, Severity

Also activate Phase 3 (Forge Identity) with an auditor/reviewer role profile from `references/domain-expertise-map.md`.

Apply this methodology to whatever the user asks to audit, review, or analyze next.
