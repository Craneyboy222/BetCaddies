description: Force COMPLEX mode on the current task, activating the full 8-phase pipeline regardless of automatic classification.
---

Override the AI Super Agent's automatic complexity classification for the current task.

Set complexity to COMPLEX, which activates ALL pipeline phases:
- Phase 0: Intake & Classify (forced to COMPLEX)
- Phase 1: Optimize Thinking (full mode)
- Phase 2: Build Methodology (full)
- Phase 3: Forge Execution Identity (full mode)
- Phase 4: Simulate Paths (synth-plan)
- Phase 5: Optimize Cost
- Phase 6: Orchestrate Agents
- Phase 7: Route Models
- Phase 8: Execute & Deliver (3-5 critique passes, full rubric + adversarial)

Use this when a task appears simple on the surface but actually requires deep analysis, or when maximum output quality is more important than speed.

After setting the override, proceed with the user's next request using the COMPLEX pipeline.
