# Skill Quality Standards

Every skill generated by skill-gen must meet these standards. Use this as a final
checklist before using a generated skill.

## The Ceiling Test

A generated skill is at the ceiling when:

1. **An expert in the domain would recognize the methodology as thorough.** If you showed
   the skill to a senior security engineer (for a security audit skill) or a principal
   architect (for an architecture review skill), they would say "yes, this covers what
   I would check" — not "this is a good start."

2. **The coverage map has no obvious gaps.** If someone can immediately name something
   the skill should check but doesn't, it's not at the ceiling.

3. **The output format enforces quality.** The output template should make it impossible
   to produce a lazy deliverable. Every finding requires evidence, location, impact, and
   a fix. Every section has minimum content expectations.

4. **The skill makes mediocrity harder than excellence.** A well-designed skill makes it
   more effort to produce bad output than good output, because the structure, checklists,
   and requirements push toward completeness.

## Mandatory Structural Requirements

### SKILL.md

- [ ] YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- [ ] Description is specific and slightly aggressive about trigger conditions
- [ ] Under 500 lines (detail in references)
- [ ] Scope section with explicit in/out boundaries
- [ ] Numbered execution phases with purpose, process, output, exit criteria
- [ ] Coverage map summary (detail in references if > 30 items)
- [ ] Output format specification with section structure
- [ ] Quality floor definition (what mediocre looks like)
- [ ] Uses imperative voice with reasoning (not just "do X" but "do X because Y")

### Reference Files

- [ ] Created for any checklist over 30 items
- [ ] Table of contents for files over 100 lines
- [ ] Items are prioritized (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)
- [ ] Each item has: what to check, why it matters, what good/bad looks like
- [ ] Organized by logical category

### Output Specification

- [ ] Every finding requires: What, Where, Why, How to fix, Severity
- [ ] Summary/executive section for quick consumption
- [ ] Detailed findings section with evidence
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and actionable (not "consider improving")
- [ ] Scoring or rating system if applicable

## Quality Anti-Patterns to Catch

**The Linter Trap**: A skill that just runs existing tools and reports their output.
Generated skills should go BEYOND what tools can catch — logic errors, design issues,
architectural problems, missing patterns.

**The Vague Checklist**: Items like "Check security" or "Review performance." Every item
must decompose to something a developer can actually check in code.

**The Format-Only Skill**: Beautiful output template but no methodology for generating
the content. A good skill tells you HOW to find issues, not just how to format them.

**The Unbounded Skill**: No scope definition, no prioritization, tries to check everything
with equal depth. Good skills have tiers so they scale with available time.

**The Copy-Paste Skill**: Generic content that could apply to any project. Good skills
are calibrated to the specific technology stack, language, and patterns in the actual
target.
